## Hello! Welcome To My Profile ðŸ‘‹

- I've been enrolled in a Full Stack Course with TripleTen for the past 8 months
- Previously had a role at ADT as a Junior National Account Manager where I oversaw site surveys, helped design security systems, worked between many groups within the company, and had daily customer/client calls.
- Always have had a love for computers and learning about how these systems and programs work and learning how to implement these skills myself in projects has been amazing!
- âš¡ Fun fact: .I am an advid rock climber and have been for the past 4 years. I was a competitive soccer player, however after an ankle injury, I transitioned into rock climbing. I've traveled to Yosemite, Bishop, and climbed Greece!
